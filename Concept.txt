IDEA
Yearly a lot of yogurt and vla goes to waste because of the way we store the package in our fridges.
Is there a way we are able to at least reduce the waste we create? The eddy aims to solve this problem
by storing the yoghurt/vla upside down in your fridge. This project can also be interesting for
Supermarkets because the bottom of a pack is mostly white. This is unused potential and can now be
put to good use.
